## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Development

This project is primarily for personal use on my own server, so active development isnâ€™t a top priority, especially with school taking up most of my time.

Before I continue adding the features I originally planned, the entire codebase either needs a complete rewrite (likely moving away from React/Next) or a major refactor. That said, I'm hoping to resume somewhat consistent development soon.
